  <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
  <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
  <div class="parent">
    <p class='formula'>ax + b = 0</p>
  </div>
  <p>where <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="math">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="math">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="math">x</span> there.</p>
  
  <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
  <p>
    The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
  </p>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class='formula'>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    where <span class="math">a</span>, <span class="math">b</span>, <span class="math">c</span> are known values and <span class="math">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="math">a</span> can't be 0.
  </p>

  <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
  <p>
    <span class="math">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="math">r</span>) squared:
  </p>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class='formula'>A = &pi; &#10005; r<sup>2</sup>  </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    or, when you know the diameter (<span class="math">D</span>):
  </p>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class='formula'>A = (&pi; / 4) &#10005; D<sup>2</sup></div>  
  </div>
  <p>
    or, when you know the circumference (<span class="math">C</span>):
  </p>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class='formula'>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#10005; &pi;</div> 
  </div>

  <h3>Intersection</h3>
  <p>
    The intersection of two sets <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
  </p>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class='formula'>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</div>  
  </div>
  <p>
    That is, <span class="math">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="math">x</span> is both an element of <span class="math">A</span> and an element of <span class="math">B</span>.
